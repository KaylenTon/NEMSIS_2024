This is the GitHub repository for **Dr. Hagen's BDA Lab NEMSIS Project (2026).** This repository is currently active. Learn more about [NEMSIS](https://nemsis.org/what-is-nemsis/) here. Data used in this project comes from NEMSIS SAS files and have been imported in R as DataFrames.  

# Get Started
1. Always begin by creating a branch and pulling from master. Do **not** work directly on the master branch. <br />
2. Click "cleaningDataFileObjects.RData" to import the sampled PcrKeys and list of variables. Learn more about NEMSIS variables [here](https://nemsis.org/media/nemsis_v3/release-3.5.0/DataDictionary/PDFHTML/EMSDEMSTATE/index.html). <br />
3. Run up to and including line 170 (renaming clean_NA)<br />
<br />
Now, you will have the cleaned NEMSIS DataFrame to begin data analysis.<br />
